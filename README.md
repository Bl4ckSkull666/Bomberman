# Bomberman
A bukkit plugin

I'm currently rebuilding bomberman from the ground up. When I'm finished,
bomberman should have a much cleaner and better api which will (hopefully)
result is a much less buggy plugin.

In the rebuild, I am also thinking greatly about exensibility and I am
working towards letting other users build plugins for bomberman :)

While I'm rebuilding the plugin, I won't be updating the main bomberman brach
(except for major bug fixes).
